# Type of Triangle

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Write a query identifying the *type* of each record in the **TRIANGLES** table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- **Equilateral**: It's a triangle with $3$ sides of equal length.
- **Isosceles**: It's a triangle with $2$ sides of equal length.
- **Scalene**: It's a triangle with $3$ sides of differing lengths.
- **Not A Triangle**: The given values of *A*, *B*, and *C* don't form a triangle.

**Input Format**

The **TRIANGLES** table is described as follows:

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

```db2

/*
    Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
    1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
    2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
    3. Type your code immediately after comment. Don't leave any blank line.
*/SELECT CASE WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle' WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral' WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles' ELSE 'Scalene' END FROM TRIANGLES;

```
